# NNucleate

NNucleate is a Python package developed for the training of approximations of collective variables (CV). The primary intended application is enhanced sampling simulations of nucleation events. These types of simulations are typically limited by the computational cost of their CVs, since they require a computationally expensive, differentiable degree of order in the system to be calculated on the fly.
